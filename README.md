Millions of people with autism, speech delays, or neurological conditions rely on assistive apps to communicate. But most of these tools only allow selecting basic words or symbols — not forming full sentences. That often leads to unclear communication and frustration for both users and their families.

⚙️ How It Works
NeuroTalk AI is a web-based platform where users pick simple words or categories — like “hungry,” “no cheese,” or “pasta.” The app uses artificial intelligence to turn those into a full, natural sentence (e.g., “I’m hungry, but I don’t want cheese. I’d like some pasta.”)

It supports real-time sentence building, multilingual output, customizable vocab, and a growing AI model that learns and improves over time.

💡 Why It Matters
NeuroTalk AI empowers people with communication barriers to speak in full, human-like sentences — not just isolated words. It provides clarity, dignity, and greater independence to users, while easing communication for families, educators, and caregivers.

It also democratizes assistive communication by offering multilingual, AI-powered tools that are accessible through a freemium web platform — instead of expensive hardware or outdated apps.
